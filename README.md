dockerfile-dwarffortress
========================

Dwarf Fortress in a container. Tested on Mint 15 and 16.

Usage
-----

Make sure you are in the same directory as the Dockerfile

    cd dockerfile-dwarffortress

Build the image and tag it DwarfFortress. The -rm options cleans the cache after the final image has been created.

    docker build -t DwarfFortress -rm .

If you want to run in text mode

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -p TEXT df_linux/df

In order to run in 2D mode you need to map stuff from the host to the container

    docker run -t -i -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd -lxc-conf='lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 116:* rwm' -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY DwarfFortress

DfHack is included in the container, to use it simply specify the path to it when running the container

    docker run -t -i -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd -lxc-conf='lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 116:* rwm' -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY DwarfFortress df_linux/dfhack

To see all the options available, get help

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -h

Remember, if you pass any options (other than -h) you also have to specify the path to either the df binary:

    df_linux/df

 or the dfhack script

    df_linux/dfhack

For example the following will NOT work:

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -p TEXT -s

Instead it should be:

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -p TEXT -s df_linux/df
