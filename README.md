dockerfile-dwarffortress
========================

Dwarf Fortress in a container. Tested on Mint 15 and 16.

Usage
-----

Make sure you are in the same directory as the Dockerfile

    cd dockerfile-dwarffortress

Build the image and tag it DwarfFortress. The -rm options cleans the cache after the final image ha been created.

    docker build -t DwarfFortress -rm .

If you want to run in text mode

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -p TEXT

In order to run in 2D mode you need to map stuff from the host to the container

    docker run -t -i -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd -lxc-conf='lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 116:* rwm' -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY DwarfFortress


Debugging
---------

The entrypoint is set to the start.sh bash script included in the repository. As well as allowing certain DwarfFortress init.txt options to be set using commandline parameters is also provides an additiona -x parameter which will execute any value it is provided. So as an example to get a shell instead of launching DwarfFortress you could run:

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -x /bin/bash

If you need to pass parameters use single quotes, for example to list the files in the root path of the container:

    docker run -t -i DwarfFortress -x 'ls -al'
